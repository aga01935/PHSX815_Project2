# PHSX815_Project2
## This is the Project 2 for the PHSX815
This code is written in python and most of the codes can be found on the folder python

I have changed my distribution from project 1 to take a value from another distribution.

<ol>
<li> Random.py : Generate the random number for prabolic and linear distribution</li>
<li> Simulator.py: Calls Random.py and generate random number with defined number of measurement and number of expriment by option -Nmes and -Nexp respectively.</li>

<li> ElectricityUse.py: Use data simulated by simulator.py and produced the plots and obtain log likelihood ratio. </li> 
</ol>
To reproduce the result, anyone just have to run the script runproject.sh. runproject.sh is hardcoded with parameter that I used to produce the plot I presented on the project paper.
